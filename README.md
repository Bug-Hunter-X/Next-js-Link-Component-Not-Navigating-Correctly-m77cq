# Next.js Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component. The links are defined correctly, but the application fails to navigate to the specified routes. This issue may arise due to misconfigurations in the routing setup or unexpected interactions within the Next.js application.  The solution showcases how to rectify this problem by ensuring the `Link` components are correctly implemented and integrated with your application's routing configuration.  Additionally, potential causes like improper `next/router` usage or conflicts with other libraries are explored.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Click on the links; Observe that the navigation may not work as expected.

## Solution

The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) provides a corrected implementation of the `Link` component, resolving the navigation issue.  The solution may involve double-checking the `href` prop values, reviewing your routing configurations in `pages/` directory, or addressing conflicts with other components or libraries.
